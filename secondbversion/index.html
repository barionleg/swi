I went to look from a wall I had built overlooking the plain. I learned a dreadful thing, though I lost not my head.</p><br>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="552">552</A></FONT></span>"Two pedestrians appeared, I went to meet them; it was a woman with a slave; I recognized who was coming,</p><br>  
<p><A NAME="page_88"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 88</FONT></A></p><br>  
<p>it was Asmat&#8217;h, with dishevelled head, blood flowing from her face; no more did she call to me smiling, nor did she greet me with a smile.</p><br>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="553">553</A></FONT></span>"When I saw her I became perturbed; my mind was maddened. I cried from afar: 'What has befallen us, why does the fire consume us?' She wept pitifully, she could hardly utter words, she said to me: 'God has engirt the sphere of the heavens in wrath for us!'</p><br>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="554">554</A></FONT></span>"I came near, I inquired again: 'What has happened to us? Tell me the truth.' Again she wept aloud piteously, again the flame burned her; for a long time she could speak no word to me, not the tenth part of her griefs, her breast was dyed crimson with the blood trickling from her cheeks.</p><br>
